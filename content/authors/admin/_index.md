Iâ€™m a Robotics Engineer working at HALCON in the Robotics & Automation department. I hold a MSc in Robotics and Autonomous Systems from University of Bristol, where I worked on multi-agent systems, game theory, evolutionary algorithms and artificail intelligence. Prior to this I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at ALGO8 after passing out from the International Institute Of Information Technology, Pune, with a BEng in electronics.
