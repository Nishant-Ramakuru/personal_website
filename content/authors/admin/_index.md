Greetings to my website Folks!


Iâ€™m a Dynamic Robotics Graduate with a cross disciplinary background in Computer Science, Electrtonics and Mechanical Designing, with a focus on AI in Robotics, and a proven track record in designing and implementing advanced robotic systems. Possessing a solid research background, adept at merging AI techniques with robotics to enhance automation processes. Currently working at [HALCON](https://halcon.ae/) in the Robotics & Automation department as a Robotics & AI Engineer. 

I hold a MSc in Robotics and Autonomous Systems from [University of Bristol, UK](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), where I published my dissertation, [Designing Considerate Swarms](https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/isal2021/33/86/102901) in MIT press, at the ALIFE 2021. Prior to this I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [ALGO8](https://algo8.ai/) after passing out from the International Institute Of Information Technology, Pune, with a BEng in Electronics.
