I am an associate professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University. My research and writing explore how class conflict and compromise intersect with democracy and development. My work has been published in leading political science journals and my research has received support from institutions like the Wilson Center, the Smith Richardson Foundation and the United States Institute of Peace. My first book, Managing Dissent, was published with Cornell University Press explored the dynamics of state-labor relations and industrial conflict following the implementation of neoliberal economic reforms in South Asia. My current book project looks at how India has used development policy to confront its long-running Maoist insurgency. I also have a strong interest in labor standards and understanding how labor unions, nonprofit organizations, consumers and corporations can help to promote them.   

At GW, I teach courses on comparative politics, comparative political economy and South Asia. I am on faculty in the Department of Political Science and the Elliott School and am affilaited with the Sigur Center for Asian Studies as well as the Institute for International Economic Policy. I also serve as one of the managing editors for the Journal of Development Studies.
