Many inventions came up in the history of science and technology. Among them, the invention of robots is drastically emerging. Speed and economic advantages in daily life has increased the use of robots. A robot is an electro-mechanical system which can do autonomous or pre-programmed tasks. When wheels have dominated the robot world and seem extremely popular, innovators are struggling to find a decent replacement for wheels which would work in any kind of an environment. Adding legs to robots would be a solution for robots which runs on unprepared terrain. Now arises the problem of stability. 

To overcome this, we propose a self-adaptive smart spider robot that functions without human interfacing. The legged robot inspired by spider is developed with the control mechanism and machine learning algorithms which results in the execution of various walking behaviour by adapting itself. The effectiveness of the robot is measured according to the performance on rough terrain through six legs. Control of robot is provided via communication port on computer. Functional algorithms are built for flexible motion against different conditions such as rough terrain, pit. Due to machine learning there will be no bounds for the robot in the near future it will learn to adapt as well as grow mentally as time goes by
