The use of manipulator robots in industry has risen exponentially in the last decade due to advances in the control algorithms that enable complex tasks to be automated. These robots come in different types and sizes, and usually the structures and the number of joints associated with the robot determine its type. The aim of this assignment is first to simulate a Lynxomotion manipulator robot, the robot consists of five revolute joints and one prismatic joint at the end effector to mimic the grapping action. The second task is to model a 3RRR parallel robot which consists of a closed-loop kinematic chain where the endeffector is positioned in the base by varies independent kinematic chains. Parallel robots have grasped significant interest due to their high rigidity and accuracy as well as the ability of withstanding high payloads. Ones the mechanism of these robots is described, the report will explain the methods taken to model the kinematics as well as workspace analysis performed.
