## Spurious Correlation

- Does correlation = causation?

- **Spurious correlation** occurs when two variables appear to be directly linked in a cause-effect relationship but in fact (a) there is no causal link whatsoever; or (b) they are linked indirectly by some other causal variable or variables

- Occurs when we cannot specify or demonstrate the mechanism
