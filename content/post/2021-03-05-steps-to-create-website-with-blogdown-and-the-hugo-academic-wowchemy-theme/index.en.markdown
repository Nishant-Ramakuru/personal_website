Given a Transfer Funtion for a Spring Damper System, 
Y(s)/𝑈(𝑠)= 1/(𝑠^2 + 0.6s + 4)

The mass spring damper system is used for the main purpose of producing oscillations based on some linear input. This system can be used in situations where oscillations are desired such as simulating earthquakes or flight simulation models or to reduce them such as suspension systems of automobiles etc.
