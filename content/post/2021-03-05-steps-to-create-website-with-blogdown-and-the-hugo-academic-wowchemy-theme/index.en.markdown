A practical engineering plant which would feature similar dynamical behaviour  to the theoretical dynamics given in the plant description below represents that of 
spring damper system.
Y(s)
𝑈(𝑠)
=
1
𝑠
2 + 0.6s + 4
The mass spring damper system is used for the main purpose of producing 
oscillations based on some linear input. This system can be used in situations
where oscillations are desired such as simulating earthquakes or flight simulation 
models or to reduce them such as suspension systems of automobiles etc.
